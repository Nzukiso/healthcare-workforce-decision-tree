# Predicting Turnover Intention in the Healthcare Workforce using Decision Trees

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the **Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset** (Kaggle, 2025) to predict turnover intention among healthcare employees.  
The aim is to identify key predictors such as **job satisfaction, stress level, and burnout frequency** and evaluate the model’s performance.  

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data preprocessing (encoding, cleaning).
2. Exploratory data analysis.
3. Decision tree model training (entropy criterion, depth control).
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score).
5. Visualization of results (feature importance, simplified tree, confusion matrix).

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~78%  
- Recall (turnover intention): 81%  
- Precision: 75%  
- F1-score: 0.78  

Key predictors: Job satisfaction, stress level, and burnout frequency.
