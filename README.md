# Predicting Turnover Intention in the Healthcare Workforce using Decision Trees

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the **Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset** (Kaggle, 2025) to predict turnover intention among healthcare employees.  
The aim is to identify key predictors such as **job satisfaction, stress level, and burnout frequency** and evaluate the model’s performance.  

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data preprocessing (encoding, cleaning).
2. Exploratory data analysis.
3. Decision tree model training (entropy criterion, depth control).
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score).
5. Visualization of results (feature importance, simplified tree, confusion matrix).

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~78%  
- Recall (turnover intention): 81%  
- Precision: 75%  
- F1-score: 0.78  

Key predictors: Job satisfaction, stress level, and burnout frequency.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `decision_tree_analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `report.pdf` → Academic report (~5 pages)
- `figures/` → Visualizations (tree, feature importance, confusion matrix)
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 📑 Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaggle: [Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (synthetic, educational use only).

## 📊 Excel Dashboards
In addition to the Python analysis, I created interactive Excel dashboards using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Slicers.

Dashboards include:
1. Department vs. Burnout Frequency  
2. Job Satisfaction vs. Turnover Intention  
3. Access to EAPs vs. Mental Health Absences  
4. Department vs. Turnover Intention (PivotTable)

Two interactive slicers (Department, Stress Level) allow users to filter results dynamically.
